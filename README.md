# Wordtab - Create data structures from text.
## Installing:
There is no install target, so you can only 'make' and not 'make install.'

$> make

Should produce the wordtab executable. 

## Using:
Wordtab reads from standard input. If entering words by hand, you can terminate the input and trigger the printing of data tables with <ctrl+d>.

## Example target:
The 'trotsky' folder contains a makefile that downloads some public domain text for generating tables. Pre-processing is a work in progress...
